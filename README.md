## https-resources

a repo for storing resources, can be only accessed with https protocol

***Notice that: JavaScript file from githubusercontent is not executable for loading to execute. You should change like this:***

**Example: http://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/branch/file.js**

For non-production environments, such as jsFiddle, replace raw.github.com with rawgit.com:

http://rawgit.com/user/repo/branch/file.js

For production environments, replace raw.githubusercontent.com with cdn.rawgit.com:

http://cdn.rawgit.com/user/repo/tag/file.js
